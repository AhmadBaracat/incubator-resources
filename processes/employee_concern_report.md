Employee Concern Report
=======================

Bleh. Poor performance or issues with employees is the absolute worst part of running or managing any company. Instead of looking at it as an awkward conversation though, we try to embrace it as an opportunity to see what improvements need to be made and how BOTH parties (employee AND company) can make changes so we can get back to running like a well oiled machine. 

Below is an example of a concern report. After 2 of these, more serious action is taken. Thankfully, it rarely gets to this point.
