Digital Media 
=========

Some may call it social media or whatever the latest buzzword is, but nowadays can't we just agree that it's big enough that it is just *media?* 


#Sharing Content

Anyways, as part of Codelitt Incubator, it is everyone's responsibility to communicate and provide value with our audience. A large part of our responsibility to our community and customers is to disseminate useful information that will provide value to them. This may be:

- New technology
- Thought leadership 
- Provoking and intriguing articles 
- Expert opinions
- Articles that support our value prop and mission
- Misc. useful information

As you come across this valuable information, whether it be a link or a thought in your head, you should add it to our [Buffer](http://buffer.com) queue and share it across our other social channels that matter. 

###Tools

- [Buffer](http://buffer.com) - Buffer is a handy queue tool which enables you to throw links, thoughts, and information into a queue which schedules and regularly delivers posts to 4-5 of the major social platforms (namely Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn) 

###Process

1. Come across interesting thought, article, link, etc
2. Copy 
3. Paste into Buffer with title. I like to add commentary as well to provide more value. 
4. Click add to queue
5. Is this content particularly unique and powerful? Perhaps its something that is unique to us that we've written? Perhaps it's more obscure? Perhaps it's just really, really incredible? Then share as well on the more high brow news sites like news.ycombinator.com and *certain* subreddits such as /r/startups /r/entrepreneur or wherever deemed appropriate. 

#Contributing answers

Sites such as Stackoverflow, Hackernews, tech/startup subreddits, Quora, etc offer great opportunities for us to contribute our expertise and knowledge directly to someone who is requesting it. Whereas sharing content is a bit like driving an ice cream truck down the street playing a tune and hoping that someone wants ice cream, these Q&A formatted sites are more like being an ice cream delivery service that delivers on-demand when someone is specifically inquiring about it. 

These offer a higher value to contribute in a meaningful way. Take advantage of these. 

###Dos and Don'ts

- Avoid over self-promoting. It's okay to establish why you're an authority on the subject you're answering, but certainly avoid coming across as doing so for your own benefit.
