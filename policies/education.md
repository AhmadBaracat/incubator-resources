Education
==========

In an effort to help you all meet your professional goals for the next quarter, the company has agreed to paid for your education through approved educational programs and efforts. Now as with most educational programs, this would be education done on your own time. It's exciting to offer you the opportunity to grow, but also remember that partner projects are your priority. If you're all caught up on them, then by all means use your extra time to learn or do exercises, but normally education is an extracurricular activity.

To enroll in an education program, speak with Cody or Tony about the opportunities and programs available.
