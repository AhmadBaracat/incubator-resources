Paid and unpaid holiday
========================

Starting your first year, you are given 2 weeks of paid vacation. Second year, you are given 3 weeks of paid vacation. 

Please give advance notice so we can account for the time you will be out of the office and shift workloads. We do not guarantee any vacation time with less than 2 weeks advance notice. 1 month advance notice is preferred and smiley faces are given.

While we do not monitor the hours that you work and you're free to set your own schedule, taking time off without notification could result in a [Concern Report.](process/hr/employee_concern_report.md)

There are no limit to sick days unless and abusive pattern becomes prevalent.
