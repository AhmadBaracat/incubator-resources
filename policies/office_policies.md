Office Policies

##Work hours
We are a remote team that favours progress and results over set hours. You may work from midnight to 8 in the morning if you like. 

These freedoms do come with conditions:

- 40 hour a week minimum for full time employees
- If working under 40 hours a week to accomplish your weekly projects/tasks, you tackle new features/tasks/projects work a 40 hour minimum. 
- You make yourself available for the 9 a.m. EST standups
- You make yourself available for any normal workday calls which your position is responsible for being a part of.
