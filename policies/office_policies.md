Office Policies
===============


##Work hours
We are a remote team that favours progress and results over set hours. You may work from midnight to 8 in the morning if you like. 

These freedoms do come with conditions:

- You make yourself available for the 9 a.m. EST standups
- You make yourself available for any normal workday calls which your position is responsible for being a part of. 
- We encourage you to spend any free time you have doing research, contributing to open source projects, working on your 20% time projects, and optimizing tasks, code, whatever!
